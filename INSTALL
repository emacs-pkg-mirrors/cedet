CEDET: Collection of Emacs Development Enviromnent Tools

CEDET is a top-level project containing several individual package for Emacs,
includeing:

   EIEIO - CLOS layer for Emacs Lisp
   Semantic - Parser Infrastructure for Emacs
   Speedbar - Everything browser
   EDE - File manager/ Makefile generator
   COGRE - Connected Graph Editor

You can install all these packagees at once with the CEDET build and
install scripts:

1) Copy source files somewhere.

2) Byte compile

   a) make

   -OR-

   b) make EMACS=<your favorite emacs>

  You might also have trouble with makeinfo.  If you need to upgrade
  makeinfo, you can do this:

  c) make MAKEINFO=/usr/local/bin/makeinfo

  Note: For speedbar, you may also need to byte-compile the version
  of INFO and RMAIL that come with your version of emacs.

  d) make MAKEINFO=echo

  To skip making the doc.

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.
