Semantic is a program for Emacs which includes, at its core, a lexer,
and a compiler compiler (bovinator).  Additional tools include a
bnf->semantic table converter, example tables, and a speedbar tool.

The core utility is the ``semantic bovinator'' which has similar
behaviors as yacc or bison.  Since it is not designed to be as feature
rich as these tools, it uses the term ``bovine'' for cow, a lesser
cousin of the yak and bison.

In it's current state, the bovinator is both fast (because it uses emacs
tricks) and slow (it is recursive, and not table (array) based).  If you
have experience with compiler compilers (bison, yacc, etc) your help to
make these updates would be greatly appreciated.

Because the bovinator is recursive, you may need to add the following to
your .emacs file:

@code{(setq max-specpdl-size 1000)}

@chapter Preparing your language for Lexing

In order to reduce a source file into a token list, it must first be
converted into a token stream.  Tokens are syntactic elements such as
whitespace, symbols, strings, lists, and punctuation.

The lexer uses the major-mode's syntax table for conversion, so as long
as that is set up correctly (along with the important
@code{comment-start-skip} variable) you should be ok.

To extend the flexer, you can use the variable @code{semantic-flex-extensions}.

@defvar semantic-flex-extensions
For a given language buffer, this is an associatoin list.  The key is a
regular expression used to match text in the buffer.  The data element
is a function which will be called when that text is encountered.

The function should return a list of the form:
@example
(TYPE START . END)
@end example
nil is also valid in case the text does not satisfy some other criterion.

TYPE can be any type of symbol, as long as it doesn't occur as a
nonterminal in the language definition.
@end defvar

@chapter Preparing a bovine table for your language

When converting a source file into a nonterminal token stream
(parse-tree) it is important to specify rules to accomplish this.  The
rules are stored in the buffer local variable
@code{semantic-toplevel-bovine-table}.

While it is certainly possible to write this table yourself, it is most
likely you will want to use the BNF converter.  @xref{BNF conversion}.
This is an easier method for specifying your rules.  You will still need
to specify a variable in your language for the table, however.  A good
rule of thumb is to call it @code{langauge-toplevel-bovine-table} if it
part of the language, or @code{semantic-toplevel-language-bovine-table}
if you donate it to the semantic package.

When initializing a major-mode for your language, you will set the
variable @code{semantic-toplevel-bovine-table} to the contents of your
language table.  @code{semantic-toplevel-bovine-table} is always buffer
local.

Since it is important to know the format of the table when debugging
@xref{Debugging}, you should still attempt to understand the basics of
the table.

Please see the documentation for the variable
@code{semantic-toplevel-bovine-table} for details on it's format.

@chapter Using the BNF converter to make bovine tables

The BNF converter takes a file in "Bovine Normal Form" which is similar
to "Backus-Naur Form".  If you have ever used yacc or bison, you will
find it similar.

It is important to have an Emacs Lisp file with a variable ready to take
the output of your table @xref{Bovinating}.  Also, make sure that the
file @file{semantic-bnf} is loaded.  Give your language file the
extension @file{.bnf} and you are ready.

The comment character is @asis{#} and you will want to place a comment
near the top of the file which looks like this:

@example
# TABLE: semantic-ex.el:semantic-toplevel-c-bovine-table
@end example

This lets you specify the file and variable where you want this
language file to be parsed to.  When you want to test your file, use the
keyboard shortcut @kbd{C-c C-c} to parse the file, generate the
variable, and load the new definition in.  You will then have to re-run
your major-mode in the desired buffer for it to take effect.

Writing the rules should be very similar to bison for basic syntax.
Each rule is of the form

@example
RESULT : MATCH1 (optional-lambda-expression)
       | MATCH2 (optional-lambda-expression)
       ;
@end example

@var{RESULT} is a non-terminal, or a token synthisized in your grammar.
@var{MATCH} is a list of elements that are to be matched if @var{RESULT}
is to be made.  The optional lambda expression is a list containing
simplified rules for concocting the parse tree.

@var{MATCH} is made up of symbols and strings.  A symbol such as
@code{foo} means that a syntactic token of type @code{foo} must be
matched.  A string in the mix means that the previous symbol must have
the additional constraint of exactly matching it.  Thus, the
combination:
@example
  symbol "moose"
@end example
means that a symbol must first be encountered, and then it must
@code{string-match "moose"}.  Be especially careful to remember that the
string is a regular expression.  The code:
@example
  punctuation "."
@end example
will match any punctuation.

The OLE (Optional Lambda Expression) is converted into a bovine lambda
@xref{Bovinating}. This lambda has special short-cuts to simplify
reading the emacs bnf definition.  An OLE like this:
@example
 ( $1 )
@end example
results in a lambda return which consists entirely of the string
or object found by matching the first (zeroeth) element of match.
An OLE like this:
@example
( ,(foo $1) )
@end example
executes `foo' on the first argument, and then splices it's return
into the return list whereas:
@example
( (foo $1) )
@end example
executes foo, and that is placed in the return list.

Here are other things that can appear inline:
@table @code
@item $1
the first object matched.
@item ,$1
the first object spliced into the list (assuming it is a list from a
non-terminal)
@item '$1
the first object matched, placed in a list.  ie ( $1 )
@item foo
the symbol foo (exactly as displayed)
@item (foo)
a function call to foo which is stuck into the return list.
@item ,(foo)
a function call to foo which is spliced into the return list.
@item '(foo)
a function call to foo which is stuck into the return list in a list.
@end table

@chapter Compiling a language file with the bovinator

From a program you can use the function @code{semantic-bovinate-toplevel}.
This function takes two optional parameters.  First is the DEPTH which
defaults to 0.  The lexer takes a DEPTH parameter which is used to
determine if @code{open-paren} and @code{close-paren} tokens are
returned, or if @code{semantic-list} tokens are returned.

The second command TRASHCOMMENTS defaults to nil, and indicates if
comments should be automatically stripped when they are encountered.

Another function you can use is @code{semantic-bovinate-nonterminal}.
This command takes a token stream returned by the function
@code{semantic-flex} followed by a DEPTH (as above).  This takes an
additional optional argument of NONTERMINAL which is the nonterminal in
your table it is to start parsing with.

As a user, you can run the command @code{bovinate} which runs the
previously mentioned command, and displays the returned tokens in a
buffer.  This is a great tool for testing tables as you develop them.

@chapter Debugging a bovine table.

To debug a language is a two step process.  The first tells emacs where
to find the source code to the bovine table.  The second is to run the
debugger from a language file that uses the table.

To set a table, put the cursor in the table, and run the command
@code{semantic-bovinate-debug-set-table}.  Emacs records the location
for debugging.  Next place the cursor in the language file you want to
debug, and run the command @code{bovinate-debug}.  This command opens
the table and language file, and highlights the apropriate pieces
depending on what it is about to look at.  Details about the current
state are shown in the minibuffer.

Pressing any key advances.  @kbd{C-g} halts the debugger.

@node Non-Terminals, , Debugging, Top
@chapter Using the Non-Termianal Stream

The list of nontermianls returned from the parser is always language
dependent, but should follow some simple conventions.  A generic entry
in the stream should be of the form

@example
("NAME" type-symbol ["TYPE"] ... "DOCSTRING" START END)
@end example

In this case, @var{NAME} is the identifier being declared.
@var{type-symbol} is a symbol representing the type of identifier being
declared.  @var{TYPE} is a string containing the text of the type of
this identifier, or nil if there is no typing information.
@refill

Additional information follows TYPE which is specific to the type of
identifier being created.  The last three entries are @var{docstring},
some documentation associated with this class, and @var{start} and
@var{end}, which describe the bounds of this definition.
@refill

Some predefined nonterminals that can be used are:

@example
(\"NAME\" variable \"TYPE\" CONST DEFAULT-VALUE MODIFIERS \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
@end example

The definition of a variable, or constant.  @var{CONST} is a boolean
representing if this variable is considered a constant.
@var{DEFAULT-VALUE} can be something apropriate such a a string, or list
of parsed elements.  @var{MODIFIERS} are details about a variable that
are not covered in the @var{TYPE} field.  @var{DOCSTRING} is optional.
@refill

@example
(\"NAME\" function \"TYPE\" ( ARG-LIST ) \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
@end example

A function/procedure definition.  @var{DOCSTRING} is optional.  @var{ARG-LIST} is
a list of variable definitions.

@example
(\"NAME\" type \"TYPE\" ( PART-LIST ) ( PARENTS ) \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
@end example

A type definition.  @var{TYPE} of a type could be anything, such as (in C)
struct, union, typedef, or class.  The @var{PART-LIST} is only useful for
structs that have multiple individual parts.  (It is recommended
that these be variables, functions or types).  @var{PARENTS} is strictly for
classes where there is inheritance.
@refill

@example
(\"FILE\" include \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
@end example

In C, an #include statement.  In elisp, a require statement.
Indicates additional locations of sources or definitions.
@refill

@example
(\"NAME\" package DETAIL \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
@end example

In Emacs Lisp, a `provide' statement.  DETAIL might be an associated
file name.
